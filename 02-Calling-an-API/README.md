# Sample 02 - Calling an API

This sample app demonstrates how to call an API using the access token retrieved during authentication. It uses [auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This will automatically start a Node + Express server as the backend on port 3001. THe Angular application is configured to proxy through to this on any `/api` route.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
